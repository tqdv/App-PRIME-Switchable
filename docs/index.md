# Documentation

## Topics

* [Rationale](rationale.md): What problem does this solve ?
* [Roadmap](roadmap.md): What to implement next ?
* [Won't implement](wont_implement.md): Dropped ideas because they were either bad or they wouldn't be satisfying solutions

## Outdated documents

* [bash_splitting](bash_splitting.md): About how to split command arguments when we executed the command in a preexec hook. There's no good solution, which is why we don't do it.
* [execution](execution.md): About how we would have run the commands in the preexec hook.
